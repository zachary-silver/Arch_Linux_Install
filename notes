# If you want to add additional window managers as options or specify a specific one
# to launch from lightDM, a desktop entry needs to be made for them at:
#
# /usr/share/xsessions/

#
# In order to generate a Modeline, enter something like "cvt 2560 1440 144"
# to get a result for width, height, and refresh rate respectively
#
# Example 10-monitor.conf file provided to be placed in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
#
# Take a look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log and search for 'Modeline' to see all the
# Modelines natively supported by your monitor and use those if generating your
# own isn't yielding the expected results.
#
# Also, 01-modesetting.conf provided to be placed in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ which will
# use the generic 'modesetting' driver instead of nouveau, amd, intel, etc. and potentially
# fix issues like refresh rate not actually being used even when xrandr claims it is.
